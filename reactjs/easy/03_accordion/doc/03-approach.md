# Approach for User Profile Component

## 1. Component Planning

- Identify the main UI elements: profile image, user name, toggle button, and bio section.
- Decide on the props/state required: user data (image, name, bio), and a boolean to track bio visibility.

## 2. Component Structure

- Create a functional React component named `UserProfile`.
- Organize the JSX to include:
  - A container div/card for the profile.
  - An image element for the profile picture (with fallback/default avatar).
  - A heading for the user's name.
  - A button to toggle the bio visibility.
  - A paragraph or div for the bio, conditionally rendered.

## 3. State Management

- Use React's `useState` hook to manage the visibility of the bio section.
- Optionally, accept user data as props or define them within the component for demo purposes.

## 4. Styling

- Use a separate CSS file or CSS-in-JS for styling.
- Style the container as a card with border, padding, and rounded corners.
- Center the content and use flexbox or grid for alignment.
- Make the profile image circular and add a subtle shadow.
- Style the button for prominence and accessibility.
- Add responsive styles for different screen sizes.

## 5. Accessibility

- Ensure the toggle button is keyboard accessible (focusable, Enter/Space triggers click).
- Add `aria-label` or `aria-expanded` attributes to the button for screen readers.
- Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<button>`, `<h2>`, `<img alt=...>`).

## 6. Responsiveness

- Use relative units (%, rem, em) for sizing and spacing.
- Add media queries to adjust layout and font sizes for mobile devices.

## 7. Enhancements

- Support emoji or icons in the bio (e.g., coffee cup emoji).
- Optionally, animate the bio section when showing/hiding.
- Allow for easy extension (e.g., add more user details in the future).

## 8. Testing

- Test the component for correct toggle behavior, accessibility, and responsiveness.
- Check with and without user image (default avatar fallback).
