# Requirement or Problem statement & Solution Approach

## 1. Problem statement

- Write a function to check Palindrome String
  - A palindrome string is the same when read forward and backward.
    Example: "racecar", "madam", "121" are palindromes string.

## 2. Features / Usecase

## 3. Understand the problem with sample inputs & outputs

### Sample - 1

- Input: "racecar"
- Output: "racecar"

### Sample - 2

- Input: "madam"
- Output: "madam"

## 4. Approach

### Approach - 1

- Reverse & compare with original string
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

### Approach - 2

- Two pointer approach
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
